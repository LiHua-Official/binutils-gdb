/* Query debuginfod servers for a source file associated with an
   executable with BUILD_ID. BUILD_ID can be given as a binary blob or
   a null-terminated string. If given as a binary blob, BUILD_ID_LEN
   should be the number of bytes. If given as a null-terminated string,
   BUILD_ID_LEN should be 0.

   SRC_PATH should be the source file's absolute path that includes the
   compilation directory of the CU associated with the source file.
   For example if a CU's compilation directory is `/my/build` and the
   source file path is `/my/source/foo.c`, then SRC_PATH should be
   `/my/build/../source/foo.c`.

   If the file is successfully retrieved, its path on the local machine
   is stored in FILENAME. If GDB is not built with debuginfod, this
   function returns -ENOSYS.  */
